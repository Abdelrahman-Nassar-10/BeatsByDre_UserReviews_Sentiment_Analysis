# Beats by Dre — Online Internship Capstone

A professional packaging of my capstone project from an online internship with **Beats by Dre**.
This repository contains the original analysis notebook and a clean project structure to make it easy to review, reproduce, and extend.

> **Note on data**: All data files are stored locally on my machine. To run this project, place the required data files in the appropriate folder as described below.

## Getting Started

### 1) Clone or download
If you haven't created the GitHub repository yet, see the "How to publish to GitHub" section below.
Once cloned locally:

```bash
cd beats-by-dre-capstone
```

### 2) Create a Python environment and install dependencies

Using **pip + venv**:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
# source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m ipykernel install --user --name beats-capstone --display-name "Python (beats-capstone)"
```

> If you prefer `conda`, create an env and then `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside it.

### 3) Add your data
Put your local data files in one of these locations depending on how the notebook expects paths:
- **Option A (recommended):** `data/raw/` and update any paths in the notebook accordingly, e.g. `data/raw/yourfile.csv`.
- **Option B (original layout):** Move the data files into `notebooks/` alongside the notebook if your code uses relative paths like `./somefile.csv`.

### 4) Run the notebook

Open the notebook and select the kernel you installed above:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/Beats by dre project capstone.ipynb
```

## Project Outline

This capstone explores data and insights relevant to the Beats by Dre internship tasking. The work typically includes:
- Data loading and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization
- Feature engineering and modeling (if applicable)
- Evaluation and recommendations

> See `notebooks/Beats by dre project capstone.ipynb` for the full analysis and results.

---

## Reproducibility Notes

- A `requirements.txt` is auto-generated from imports found in the notebook. If you add new libraries, update it with:
  ```bash
  pip freeze > requirements.txt
  ```
- Random seeds: If your notebook uses randomness, set seeds (e.g., `numpy`, `random`, `scikit-learn`) to ensure repeatable results.
- Figures: Save generated figures to `reports/figures/` to keep the repo tidy.

## How to publish to GitHub (first time)

1. Create a new empty repository on GitHub (without adding a README, license, or .gitignore).
2. In a terminal inside the `beats-by-dre-capstone` folder, run:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Beats by Dre internship capstone"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
git push -u origin main
```

> If you see an error like "failed to push some refs", run:
> ```bash
> git pull --rebase origin main
> git push -u origin main
> ```
